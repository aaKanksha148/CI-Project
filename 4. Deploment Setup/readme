The trained model files (.pkl) were not uploaded due to GitHub’s file size limitations. Re-run "train.py" to generate them.
Note: Model `.pkl` files are not included in the repository due to GitHub's file size limits.
Please run `train.py` to generate the following files before running GUI or Deployment:

- stroke_model.pkl
- scaler.pkl
- imputer.pkl
- encoders.pkl
- feature_cols.pkl

Place these files inside both:
1. /deployment
